### Project Summary

This project provides an example of group research I was apart off, which is available for viewing in the pdf attached (Research-Updated).

The goal of the paper was to investigate various possible opportunities and current implementation of AI in  retail that are and could be used to improve customer experiences and business operations. We have identified four separate areas of focus based on individual interests within the customer relationship management cycle which are: Marketing, Real Time Data Analysis, Cross Selling, Customer Retention and Churn.


### Results

The various areas of the retail business discussed in the paper suggest that the data collected and analysed using AI based techniques such as neural networks, association rule mining, recommendation systems and chatbots can bring huge benefits for businesses. It helps to make strategic decisions that increase profits, decrease operating expenses, and also improve customer satisfaction by providing more personalised services and reducing the frustration from SOOS problems. However, not many businesses can or have implemented AI due to data privacy, difficulty of use due to a lack of expertise and literature, as well as funding to build the digital infrastructure required.

### Structure and Procedures

 1. Define and select areas of group research interest.
 
    * Accounting for the interest of each member and time frame. A to be final topic of research was decided upon based on preliminary research from the literature.
 
  
 2. Perform individual research in selected areas to refine research goals.
 
    * Each member created an individual methodology to answer research questions in their selected area. Then a grouped methodology as created from the individual that could be followed by everyone based on common questions, alignment of goals and feasibility.
     
     
 3. Iterate and share progress. 
 
    * Following through with the group methodology to answer questions in each member selected areas, we discussed findings and potential need to further refine goals and paper structure.
